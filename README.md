<div align="center">Many thanks to the great work of the GraphQL community & Apollo for providing the boilerplate for this widget (https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql).</div>

1. Yarn install && Yarn start.
2. Make sure you have WordPress with the GraphQL extension installed and the endpoint exposed for querying (likely https://mysite.com/graphql
3. Enqueue the correct react and react-DOM dependencies, or just link to the scripts if using a static HTML page (https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html). I used the development versions as I noticed there were issues loading the minified build of react in WordPress.
